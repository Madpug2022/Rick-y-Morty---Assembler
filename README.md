### Description
<hr>

This is one of the first projects i made. Is really clumsy and i dont like it. <br>
It consumes a public Rick & Morty API wich includes all the information of the show. It is not visually appealing so i will refactor it later using react or angular16. <br>

** This project implements: ** HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and Typescript. **

** Responsive ** This project is responsive, you can use it in desktop computer or mobile version.
